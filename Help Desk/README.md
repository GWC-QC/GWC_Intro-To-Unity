### **My project won't load / I can't download Unity Hub / Any concerns about setting up.**

I'm more than happy to help guide you through the process, but please check out the other documents I've provided first. If you hit an error that's not addressed, feel free to contact me and we can discuss it. I won't be able to help with this

### **I don't know how to navigate the scene view.**

All of the tools you need are your mouse, and the tools in the upper right hand corner. 
* The hand tool can change what part of the grid your looking at by dragging.
* The move tool will change the x,y position of a game object, make sure the object you want to move is selected in the hierarchy tab.

Those are the only important ones you'll be using predominantly in the workshop.
