# GWC Intro To Unity & Game Development

Game Development runs the world in entertainment! From IOS games to PC games, Unity is one of the top game development platforms available for free. Learn what encompasses game development, the basics of navigating the Unity interface, and creating your first C# script for Unity! You will leave the workshop with the basics, and a short 2D game. 

**Learning Goals:**
* Learn how to navigate the Unity Interface and understand the scene, hierarchy, project, inspector, and console tab.
* Understand the camera and coordinate system.
* Create game objects, animate 2D sprites, and play audio.
* Create basic C# behavioural components.
* Create a short 2D game!

**Before you attend:**
* Know the basics of programming [loops, predicates, etc.], you do not need to be adept at C# to follow this workshop. 
* Download Unity Hub and the required version for this workshop. See installation instructions below.
* Follow instructions for the SetUp_GameProject.md file. You need to have the workshop folder installed, and your game project ready to be modified, before the workshop day.

3. Once you are finished downloading the Unity Hub, visit https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive. We are downloading the latest version, specifically version 2020.3.22f1. If you are not given this option in the Unity Hub, seek out the archive to download the appropriate version.

4. Once you are prompted to download, install your computer's build support. This is important, you need to have at the bare minimum your computer's support so you can run and build the game. This workshop has been optimized for Mac and Windows support.

5. You may be prompted to download Visual Studio 2019 Community edition. You just need anything that can modify code. It's not required to have for the workshop, but feel free to download it if you want faster compilition through that interface, and shortcuts for Unity methods/objects.

6. Finally, sit back and relax while your download finishes. You'll be able to create projects using that version, which will be reviewed in the next section.
