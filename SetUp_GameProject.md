# Set up your game project

1. To prepare to move assets into your workshop game project, create a new game project. Select 'New'. If you have multiple versions, select the arrow to select the right version.

2. You'll see a pop up for picking a template for your game. Select 2D, and name your project however you like. The name of the game is 'Yarnball Chase.' Save your game project in a folder you can access freely later, it'll be important! Click create, and Unity will set up the game project.

4. Once its done compiling, you should see the Unity interface as follows. Don't worry about all the other tabs, for now only care about the project folder tab for your project.

5. Once loaded, save your scene. Feel free to name it however you like, but for continuity sake we'll name it as the game name. We will only be using one scene for this game. You will see the Unity object appear in your project folder.
